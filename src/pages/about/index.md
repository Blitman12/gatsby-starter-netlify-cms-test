## **Who am I**

My name is Brad Litman and I was born and raised in Arizona. I am really big into fitness and just recently discovered I actually enjoy reading. I never thought I would be a book guy but here we are. Aside from exercise and books I like to spend my time playing video games and relaxing with my wife, Sierra, and our two hairless cats. 

## **My goals**

I have been working hard to develop my skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and other frameworks to get a job working as a Front-End Web Developer. I have used many resources like Codecademy, Pluralsight, Free Code Camp, Youtube and friends who work in the field. I have discovered this new passion and am excited to learn more and see where this takes me. 

## **Current work**

I am currently working as a nurse for a credit card company. I can imagine your question: "What would a nurse be doing at a credit card company?" Well I asked the same thing in the job interview. I don't want to bore you so I will just jot down some cool stuff I get to do: Phlebotomy, Emergency Response, EKG`s, Acute Visits, and more! 

## **What will I find here**

This was built for a test blog to work with Netlify CMS. There will be a conglomeration of random posts about things I am interested in. Games, Weights, Animals and anything else that can come to mind. I hope you enjoy it!
